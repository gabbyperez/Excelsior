<h2> Kim Namjoon</h2>
<body> Kim Namjoon, also known as RM or Rap Monster, is the leader and lead rapper of BTS. He also released his first mixtape on March 17, 2015. He has come a long way from just being and average South Korean boy to now a famous rapper, songwriter and producer at the age of 24. He also was one of the youngest people to speak at the United Nations earlier this year. He is an incredible person and does all he can so his fans and ARMY know that we are worth more than what the world lables us as.
